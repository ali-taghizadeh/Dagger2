# Dagger2
In this repo, we will create a list of the latest TV shows using Retrofit and Dagger2.
# Repository Focus
Here our concentration is only on Dagger library to learn how to write a better dependency injected code.
I am trying to cover each of the most important Android concepts and libraries in a completely isolated repository.
As a result, [**MVP architecture**](https://github.com/ali-taghizadeh/Android_mvp) which is discussed before is not our point here.
A working knowledge in Retrofit library is required and there is no need to make this code more complicated using [**RX Java**](https://github.com/ali-taghizadeh/Rxjava2-operators).
After covering all these fantastic topics separately, I will create a repository and connect them together.
